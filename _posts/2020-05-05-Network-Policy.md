The SLATE team and collaborators continue to target security as a major focus.  The SLATE team is configuring all the offered  applications in the SLATE stable catalog with Kubernetes Network Policy hooks in the Helm deployment charts.  Though initially open, these hooks should allow an administrator to quickly add different ranges for restricting their applications.

By default, Kubernetes does not restrict network access to applications upon deployment. Applications provisioned with Helm will listen to all configured ports from any remote site. But what if your service requires restrictions?

## Network Policy Definition
A Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is a special object which allows an administrator to provide constraints to a service or set of services deployed in a pod. The main recommended use of this feature is to add a way to limit what IP ranges and sites can access the instance of a given application. Detailed below are instructions on how to implement such a thing in your application. Full details about network policies can be found in this [kubernetes documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

## Building a Network Policy
To explain how to build a Network Policy for a SLATE application, we use the [nginx application](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog/tree/master/stable/nginx/nginx) from the SLATE catalog as an example.  The first changes are to the NGINX Values file<<LINK?>>.  These changes allow the administrator or developer to enable the policy and to define what IP ranges they want to allow for this application. In the nginx application, this functionality is off by default.  The Enabled value is set to false and a dummy CIDR is fed in. The user would be expected to set Enabled to true and feed in their CIDRs if they wanted this to be turned on

The other piece of building a Network Policy for a SLATE application is the Network Policy template. An example of this can be found in the [network policy of the nginx app](https://github.com/slateci/slate-catalog/blob/network-policy-demo/stable/nginx/nginx/templates/NetworkPolicy.yaml). As you can see this contains two network policies, one for when the functionality is disabled and one for when it is not. The top half for both contains the metadata of the policy, which tells kubelet what this object is and what pods and services to associate it with. The difference lies in the bottom half. For the first policy the functionality is enabled, and so the yaml is set to only allow ingress and egress to/from the CIDRs supplied in the values file. The second policy doesn't limit access, and so for the allowed CIDRs an empty list is supplied. Kubernetes reads this empty list to mean Allow all. If you wanted to create a Deny all policy, than you would not supply a list at all.

## Using a Network Policy
To activate the network policy of a given application some alterations to that appâ€™s configuration must be made. To do this you will need to go onto the SLATE cluster you want to install the app on and type `slate app <app-name> get-conf`. This will give you the default configuration file for this application. Open this file in a text editor and go to the section that says `NetworkPolicy: false` and change the setting so that it is set to true. Next directly below there will be a list called AllowedCIDRs populated by dummy CIDRs. Place each of the CIDRs you want this app to be accessible to here, in the exact format that the dummy CIDRs currently are, making sure the spacing and - are placed the same as the example for each of your CIDRs.  
Finally save your changes and deploy the application using your custom configuration. To do this give the install command `slate app install <application name> cluster=<cluster name> group=<group name> conf=<name of your custom config file>`. This will deploy the application in much the same way it normally would, but with the addition of a Network Policy that blocks traffic from any IP range not in the whitelisted CIDRs specified in the configuration document. It does so by simply dropping all packets from or to those disallowed IP ranges.

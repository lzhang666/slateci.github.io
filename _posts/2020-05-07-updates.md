Welcome to another round of SLATE project updates! It's been quite some time since our last update, so this post will be especially long. On the plus side, we have a lot of cool and interesting new things to tell you about! <!--end_excerpt-->

As always, we encourage you to try things out and let us know what's working, what's not, what can be improved and so on. For discussion, news and troubleshooting, the [SLATE Slack workspace](https://slack.slateci.io/) is the best place to reach us! 

## CHANGELOG
### SLATE Console
- Assorted bug fixes, hardening and cleanup.

### SLATE Website


### Client/Server:
- The production SLATE federation now flagged to use Helm 3 by default
- Edge cluster registration refactored to address problems with auto-detection selecting private IP addresses. 
- Improved caching of available applications in the API server. 
- Updated the CLI client program to more consistently use exit status to signal failures, which should improve its usefulness in scripts. 
- Numerous fixes to the API server and catalog build system to account for changes in Helm 3. 
- Added support in the API server for automatically generating descriptions of edge cluster location using an external geocoding service. 
- Corrected mistakes in the API servers ability to collect and report storage and priority class information for edge clusters. 
- Expanded the CLI client to handle managing components like role-based access control and ingress controllers which are part of SLATE but require edge administrator privileges to manipulate to streamline installation and support updating and removal. 

# SLATE Infrastructure
- Configured all virtual machines used to form the SLATE platform which are housed at the University of Chicago to be scanned with InsightVM for security vulnerabilities
- Restructured automated builds of the CLI client to use the latest version of Alpine Linux for Linux builds, and a CentOS-based cross compiler to produce builds for Mac OS
- Work ongoing to improve Puppet infrastructure used by SLATE platform and clusters at the University of Chicago, University of Michigan, and University of Utah.
- Work ongoing to better test SLATE client/server and DynamoDB
